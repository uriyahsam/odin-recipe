  </ul>

  <h3>Frosting:</h3>

    <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons milk</li>
    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Decoration:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>24 candy eyeballs</li>
    <li>12 red candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®)</li>
    <li>60 candy corn, or as needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Make the brownies: Cream butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add egg and vanilla; mix well. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and mix until batter is smooth. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 14 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the frosting: Combine butter, cocoa powder, and milk in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar and mix until frosting is smooth and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Spoon frosting in a piping bag fitted with a Wilton #10 tip. Pipe a circle of frosting near the bottom half of each mini brownie to create the turkey's head. Add two candy eyes. Add 1 red chocolate piece to form the beak. Pipe 5 lines of frosting in the shape of a semi-circle formation coming up from the head. Place a piece of candy corn on each of the 5 lines to form the turkey's feathers.</li>
  </ol>
