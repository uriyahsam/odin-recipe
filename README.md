# 🍽️ Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built as part of **The Odin Project – Foundations** course.  
This project helped me practice essential HTML skills by building a small multi-page site.

## 📚 Skills Practiced

- Basic HTML structure & boilerplate  
- Creating and linking multiple pages  
- Using images, headings, lists, and paragraphs  
- Organizing project files into folders

## 📁 Project Structure

- **index.html** – main page listing all recipes  
- **/recipes** – folder containing individual recipe pages

Each recipe page includes:

- Dish image  
- Description section
